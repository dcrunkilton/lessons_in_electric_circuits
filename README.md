# Lessons in Electric Circuits

This is a mirror of the extremely good and free books from here:
http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/ - I am not the author.

I've added some changes to the Makefile of the AC book, such that it can be
compiled as an e-book (epub and mobi, i.e. kindle compatible). This is all work
in progress, especially the integration into the build process, so it hasn't
been added to the other books yet.
